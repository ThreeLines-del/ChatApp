# ChatApp
This is a chat app I made to learn about Firebase and broaden my knowledge of Android as a whole

# Introduction
This is a basic chat application for sending and receiving messages.

# Features
- Sign-up screen to add user info, profile pictures, and a log-in screen.
- Home screen to display a list of users and their profile pictures to send messages to.
- Chat screen to send and receive messages.

# Getting Started and Usage
The Log-in screen is displayed first for an already signed-in user but if a new user, click on the sign-up button to navigate to the Sign-up screen. Type in the user information required and add a profile picture, click Sign-up. The user is navigated back to the Log-in screen to log in. The user is navigated to the Home screen with the list of users displayed with their various profile pictures. Click on any user to navigate to the Chat screen. Users can send and receive messages from the selected user. After, the user can navigate back to the Home screen and click log-out in the top right corner.
